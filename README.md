# foundation-datepicker-sass

This is a fork of [eternicode's bootstrap datepicker](https://github.com/eternicode/bootstrap-datepicker), ported to Foundation.  The .less files converted to .scss and any required bootstrap variables shimmed into the .scss

Versions are incremented according to [semver](http://semver.org/).
