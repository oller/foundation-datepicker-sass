# foundation-datepicker-sass

Forked version of Eternicode's [original code](https://github.com/eternicode/bootstrap-datepicker) to support Zurb Foundation 5, or as a standalone datepicker.

Taking some time to manually remove all the bootstrap dependencies, and any other bloat, I intend to keep the JS files up to date with the master branch.

Versions are incremented according to [semver](http://semver.org/).

## Development

Once you cloned the repo, you'll need to install [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) and the development dependencies using [npm](https://npmjs.org/).

    npm install -g grunt-cli
    npm install
